TODO:
- run migrations on start
- linting

### Things to improve
- CI, GitHub flows etc
- descriptions for model fields
- testing the validation error in `transactions` doesnt work, even though it works in practice
- tests in `transaction` and `customers` should test directly the views, not via the URL
- depending on the requirements, maybe Customer model should be replaced by the User model
